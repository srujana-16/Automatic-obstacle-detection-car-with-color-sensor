# Automatic obstacle detection car with color sensor
Electronics Workshop-1 project

In this project, an automatic obstacle detecting car
was made. The car uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles
and avoid them. Color sensor is used to start and stop the
car. An algorithm of the navigation of the car was created and
implemented to the Arduino.
